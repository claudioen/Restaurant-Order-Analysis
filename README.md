# Restaurant-Order-Analysis
This repository contains the code and resources for the restaurant order analysis project, inspired by Maven Analytics' "Restaurant Order Analysis" project. The objective of this project is to explore and analyze a dataset of restaurant orders, using data analysis techniques to derive meaningful insights.

## Project Description
The original project from Maven Analytics provides a detailed guide for analyzing restaurant orders, covering various aspects such as data collection, cleaning, exploratory analysis, and data visualization. In this repository, I have extended and customized that approach to create a unique and in-depth analysis of the restaurant order dataset.

## Repository Structure
- data/: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- notebooks/: Includes Jupyter notebooks with the code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- images/: Contains images generated from the visualizations.
- scripts/: Python scripts used for various data processing tasks.
- README.md: This file, containing the project description.

## Dataset
The dataset used comes from [dataset source]. It contains detailed information about restaurant orders, including data such as order date and time, type of dish ordered, quantity, price, and payment method.

## Project Objectives
Data Cleaning: Removing missing data and handling anomalies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the data to understand key trends and distributions.
Data Visualization: Creating charts and visualizations to clearly represent the results.
Insights and Conclusions: Deriving significant insights from the data and formulating conclusions based on the analysis.
